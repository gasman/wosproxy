wosproxy

An HTTP proxy to (selected parts of) the World Of Spectrum archive
<ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/>, for clients that can't support
FTP, won't allow it according to security rules, or can't unzip files by
themselves.

Files can be requested zipped or unzipped - in the latter case, the first file
in the archive will be returned.

http://wosproxy/zip/path/to/file.tzx.zip
http://wosproxy/unzip/path/to/file.tzx.zip

where path/to/file.tzx.zip is a path relative to the /pub/sinclair/ directory.

Responses include the header
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
to allow remote XMLHTTPRequest access. For unzipped files, the 'X-Filename'
header indicates the original filename.
